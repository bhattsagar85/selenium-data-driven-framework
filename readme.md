#### **Selenium TestNG Data Driven - Excel**
This is a sample project to demonstrate data driven testing using Selenium + TestNG + Java + Excel.

Here, one can select tests from the excel file which tester wants to execute by providing "Runmode" to Yes in the file.

For the reporting purpose, Extent Report is used so after the test execution is completed one can get the report from "reports" folder in the workspace.
